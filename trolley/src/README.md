### Notes:
- We use the *while (1)* loop technique in order to repeatedly receive user input.
- We use the *scanf* function to read any user input, which internally removes any white space character included in the provided integer number.
- We validate the requested input type (long long int) by checking the returned value of the *scanf* function and proceed accordingly.
- We assume that the 10.000 iterations part was an exaggeration, since it's impossible for this program to be executed in approximately a second for 10.000 user input combinations (that program receives via stdin). A possible alteration to accomodate this specification would be to randomly generate 2 integers for the left are right path costs (within given range -10^18 to 10^18) 10.000 times. However, that would cause some conflicts with specifications pertaining to user inputs (since every cost would be generated by the program itself and not given by the user).
