### Notes:
- We use the "scanf" function to read any input from the user, which internally removes any white space character included in the provided integer number.
- We assume that the 10.000 iterations part was an exaggeration, since it's impossible for this program to be executed in approximately a second for 10.000 user input combinations (that program receives via stdin). A possible alteration to accomodate this specification would be to randomly generate 2 integers for the left are right path costs(within given range -10^18 to 10^18) 10.000 times. However, that would cause some conflicts with specifications relative to user inputs (since every cost would be generated by the program itself).
